The goal of this project is to create meaningful visualizations for football player analytics, including:
- ✔️Player performance metrics: Attacking, Defending, Fielding, Goalkeeping, and Overall Scores.
- ✔️Economic information: Player value, wage, release clause.
- ✔️Data transformation and segregation into different categories for better analysis.
  
This project includes:
1. Data extraction from the FIFA Index dataset.
2. Data transformation and cleaning in Python (Jupyter Notebook).
3. DAX measures and relationships set up in Power BI to visualize the data.
4. Scoring system for various player attributes.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Scoring System:**
    
    - **Attacking Score**: Calculated based on attributes such as finishing, shot power, dribbling, ball control, etc.
    - **Defending Score**: Based on attributes like interceptions, marking, tackling, strength, and aggression.
    - **Goalkeeping Score**: Derived from goalkeeping-related attributes like diving, handling, reflexes, and positioning.
    - **Overall Value**: Based on player value, wage, and release clause.
    
- **Player Segregation:**
    - Data is categorized into attacking, midfield, defending, goalkeeping, and economic categories for clearer analysis.
  
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Use Power BI to visualize key player metrics such as goal-scoring abilities, defensive capabilities, and economic statistics.

## 📊 Dataset Used
